# Pinly

Pinly is a private, friends-only social travel MVP built with Next.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, NextAuth, and Leaflet. Users can sign up, add friends, upload photo or video posts tied to places, and browse those memories on an interactive map.

## Stack
- Next.js 15 App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- NextAuth credentials auth with JWT sessions
- Neon PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM
- Leaflet + CARTO light tiles with staged server-side map aggregation
- Vercel Blob for production uploads, local filesystem uploads for local MVP demos

## Why this stack
- Fastest path to a coherent demo in a single deployable app
- Prisma gives strong relational modeling for friendships and protected posts
- NextAuth keeps email/password auth simple without introducing a second backend
- Leaflet avoids mandatory map API keys and keeps the experience privacy-forward

## Features included
- Email/password sign up and sign in
- Optional Google sign up/sign in via NextAuth OAuth
- JWT-backed session persistence
- Username search and friend requests
- Accept/decline friend requests
- Intentional place-based posts with image or video upload
- Friends-only staged memory map
- World city clusters, city hybrid view, pins, and avatar bubbles
- Popup preview to bottom-sheet to full post flow
- Layer toggle for Friends / You / Both
- Time filter sidebar
- Feed tab with recent visible posts
- City search and browse
- Post detail page
- Profile page with places summary
- Create-post location selection via place search and map tapping
- Seeded demo dataset with 5 users and 20 posts
- Validation and unit tests for critical permissions and query shapes

## Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Start Postgres:
```bash
docker compose up -d db
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
4. Generate Prisma client and apply schema:
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```
5. Seed demo data:
```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```
6. Start the app:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Demo accounts
After seeding, sign in with any of these and password `password123`:
- `avery@pinly.demo`
- `maya@pinly.demo`
- `noah@pinly.demo`
- `elena@pinly.demo`
- `leo@pinly.demo`

## Environment variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: Neon pooled PostgreSQL connection string
- `DIRECT_URL`: Neon direct PostgreSQL connection string for migrations
- `AUTH_SECRET`: long random secret for NextAuth JWT signing
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: local or deployed app URL
- `AUTH_URL`: set this to the same value as `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: required if enabling Google auth
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: required if enabling Google auth
- `STORAGE_DRIVER`: `local` for dev or `vercel-blob` for Vercel
- `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`: required when `STORAGE_DRIVER=vercel-blob`
- `BLOB_UPLOAD_PREFIX`: optional blob folder prefix
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: defaults to `public/uploads`
- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB`: upload cap, keep this at `4` for Vercel server uploads
- `ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_SEED`: leave unset locally; only use `pinly-demo` for intentional demo/staging reseeds

## Useful commands
```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run test
npm run prisma:push
npm run prisma:migrate:deploy
npm run prisma:seed
python3 tools/check_env.py
```

## Architecture notes
- Friendship rows are normalized into `userAId` and `userBId` to prevent duplicate relationships.
- Visibility is derived from accepted friendships plus the current user.
- Map queries are bounds-based and zoom-aware so the client only asks for relevant staged markers.
- City discovery reuses the same protected visibility rules as the map.
- Production uploads are routed through Vercel Blob; local filesystem storage remains available for local development.
- Prisma migrations are checked into `prisma/migrations/` so `prisma migrate deploy` can safely bootstrap Neon in production.
- Lightweight groups are currently friend-backed filter options and are intentionally structured to support a future persistent group model without changing the map flow.
- Categories are derived from post media type and text cues so the filter system is explicit today without needing a stored taxonomy.

## Tradeoffs
- No live location, background tracking, or automatic map sharing.
- Place search currently uses Nominatim for a lightweight prototype flow.
- No comments, reactions, notifications, or moderation tools.
- Post editing and deletion are not included to keep the prototype tight.
- Server-side uploads on Vercel should stay small. Larger media needs a future client-upload path.

## Deployment
- Production target: Vercel + Neon + Prisma + Vercel Blob
- Exact deployment steps and the launch checklist live in [DEPLOYMENT.md](/Users/kalebwong/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-WilfridLaurierUniversity/TravelMediaFolder/DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Final go-live runbook and manual QA flows live in [GO_LIVE.md](/Users/kalebwong/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-WilfridLaurierUniversity/TravelMediaFolder/GO_LIVE.md)
- First live deployment command order and failure-mode playbook live in [FIRST_DEPLOY_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](/Users/kalebwong/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-WilfridLaurierUniversity/TravelMediaFolder/FIRST_DEPLOY_EXECUTION_PLAN.md)
- Google OAuth callback URL: `/api/auth/callback/google` (set both local and production origins in Google Cloud)

## Future improvements
- Add a client-side upload path for larger videos
- Add place autocomplete and reverse geocoding
- Add edit/delete post flows
- Add pagination and caching on profile and city views
- Add richer integration tests with a test database
- Add password reset, email verification, and invite flows
